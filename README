# ATM Simulation System - SRV Bank

This is a simple command-line based ATM simulation system written in C++. It mimics the functionality of a basic ATM, allowing users to check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and create new accounts.

## Features

- User authentication using account number and PIN.
- View current balance.
- Deposit funds.
- Withdraw funds with balance checks.
- Create new user accounts.
- Data persistence using text files (`accountnumdata.txt`, `pindata.txt`, `balancedata.txt`).

## File Structure

- `atm.cpp` - Main source code implementing the ATM system.
- `accountnumdata.txt` - Stores account numbers.
- `pindata.txt` - Stores account PINs.
- `balancedata.txt` - Stores account balances.

## Getting Started
